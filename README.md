## vim

This is the configuration I have for vim in my daily development work. I started with the [vim-bootstrap](http://vim-bootstrap.com) configuration and then I have tunned to my needs and preferences. This configuration is Python oriented.

This configuration uses the Neobundle plugin to auto install dependencies, so you don't need to worry about them. But before you can install it you'll need:

* git
* flake8
* ctags
* silversearcher-ag

You can install it form your package manager


* **vimrc** smylink vimrc to your home dir as `.vimrc`
* vimrc.local 	custom configuration, you can use mine o tune it as your convenience. Just symlink to your home dir as `.vimrc.local`

## mysnippets

I have collected some useful vim snippets in mysnippets folder. They are mainly based on previous ones, I just copy them for convenience

You have to symlink `mysnippets` to `.vim\mysnippets`
